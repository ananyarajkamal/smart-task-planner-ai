## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Task Breakdown
Simply tell the AI your high-level goal (e.g., "Build a personal portfolio website"). The AI will intelligently decompose it into a logical sequence of actionable subtasks (e.g., "Buy domain," "Design wireframe," "Write HTML/CSS," "Deploy").

### 🗓️ Intelligent Scheduling & Prioritization
The planner doesn't just create a list; it creates a schedule. It can assign estimated durations, set deadlines, and help you prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.

### 📊 Progress Tracking
Visualize your progress with intuitive charts and progress bars. Stay motivated by seeing how much you've accomplished on your larger goals.

### 🔔 Smart Notifications & Reminders
Never miss a deadline. Get timely reminders for upcoming and overdue tasks directly in your browser or via your preferred notification method.

### 🎨 Clean & Intuitive Interface
A user-friendly, modern interface built with React (or your frontend framework) that makes managing your tasks a pleasure, not a chore.

### 💾 Data Persistence
Your tasks and plans are saved locally or in the cloud (depending on your setup), so you never lose your progress.
